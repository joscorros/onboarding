# onboarding
Hello, this is an onboarding assignment to test your knowledge in Java and Git.

You will be facing some basic java problems, such as creating classes, constructors, and an utility class with some methods, using both iterative and functional programming.

In this exercise, you will be implementing a Bill class, with 2 parameters, client and products, and some methods that can help to manage those bills.

Search for the TO-DO's in Bill.java and BillUtils.java, for further explanation of what you have to do.

The kind of variables that implement, the class, and how the method works are up to you, but there are test implemented to give you a hint of which is the best solution in each case.

Once you have finished all the TO-DO's run the test and commit your changes.

GOOD LUCK!
